abctx: a small extension showing URL-dependent links
****************************************************

"abctx" is an extension for Google Chrome that provides bookmarking feature.
The bookmarks registered in this extension are associated to the corresponding
URL patterns, and are only appearing when the current browsing URL matches the
registered patterns. 

Typical usage of the extension is to store domain-specific bookmarks.
For example, you can bookmark wiki pages on a wiki site even though the wiki 
system does not support bookmarking. The bookmarked wiki pages are only appearing
when you are accessing the wiki site, and do not necessarily require more space 
on the bookmark bar.
